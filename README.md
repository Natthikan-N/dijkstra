# Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation

This Python script demonstrates the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It utilizes a custom `Queue` class and the `Distance` class to perform the algorithm.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Ensure that Python is installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Place your graph data in a CSV file. Each row in the CSV file should represent an edge in the graph, with the first column representing the start node, the second column representing the end node, and the third column representing the distance between the nodes.

2. Run the script using the following command: python dij.py

3. Provide the graph file name when prompted.

4. Enter the start and end nodes to find the shortest path between them.

5. Repeat steps 4 and 5 as desired.

## Testing

The script includes a unit test `DijTestCase` to test the functionality of the code. To run the tests, execute the following command:
